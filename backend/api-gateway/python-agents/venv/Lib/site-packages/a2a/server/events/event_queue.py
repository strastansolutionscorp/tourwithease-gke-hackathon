        This implementation expects that dequeue to raise an exception when
        the queue has been closed. In python 3.13+ this is naturally provided
        by the QueueShutDown exception generated when the queue has closed and
        the user is awaiting the queue.get method. Python<=3.12 this needs to
        manage this lifecycle itself. The current implementation can lead to
        blocking if the dequeue_event is called before the EventQueue has been
        closed but when there are no events on the queue. Two ways to avoid this
        are to call this with no_wait = True which won't block, but is the
        callers responsibility to retry as appropriate. Alternatively, one can
        use a async Task management solution to cancel the get task if the queue
        has closed or some other condition is met. The implementation of the
        EventConsumer uses an async.wait with a timeout to abort the
        dequeue_event call and retry, when it will return with a closed error.

            no_wait: If True, retrieve an event immediately or raise `asyncio.QueueEmpty`.
